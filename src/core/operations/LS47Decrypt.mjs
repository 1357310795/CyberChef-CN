We use 7x7 characters instead of original (barely fitting) 6x6, to be able to encrypt some structured information. We also describe a simple key-expansion algorithm, because remembering passwords is popular. Similar security considerations as with ElsieFour hold.<br>The LS47 alphabet consists of following characters: <code>_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.0123456789,-+*/:?!'()</code><br>An LS47 key is a permutation of the alphabet that is then represented in a 7x7 grid used for the encryption or decryption.";
